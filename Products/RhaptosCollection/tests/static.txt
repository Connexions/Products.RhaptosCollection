Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
 	
    >>> from Products.RhaptosCollection.interfaces import ICollectionContained
    >>> from Products.RhaptosCollection.types.SubCollection import SubCollection
    >>> verifyClass(ICollectionContained, SubCollection)
    True

    >>> from Products.RhaptosCollection.interfaces import ICollectionContained
    >>> from Products.RhaptosCollection.types.BaseContentPointer import BaseContentPointer
    >>> verifyClass(ICollectionContained, BaseContentPointer)
    True
